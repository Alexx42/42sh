Hey!

Check out Simple-Fuzzer/configs to add to test cases!

run test.sh to diff files.
test script will exit when this is a difference.
42sh outputs will be in ft_shell (obv)
sh outputs will be in shell

see outputs in sequential order as they are listed in the configs file run in test_input.$x

if you look in test.sh, we are reading from Simple-Fuzzer/configs/literals right now.
Go add something or make a new config file and add that to another script. More specific scripts to come!

run clean.sh to clean up files and directories.
